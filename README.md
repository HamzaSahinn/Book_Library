# Book_Library
This repo contains the code of a library simulation. This code written Abdullah Hamza Şahin and Sinan Altınayak

You can browse or search books. You can add books to some list. The detailed usage stated in the user manual. This is only a demo/simulation of a personel library system but it is quite good to organize your books. You can edit or simply use only the list part of the program to digitalize your real library. Have fun with it!!
